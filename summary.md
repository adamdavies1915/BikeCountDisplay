# BikeCountDisplay

A real-time web display for visualizing bicycle traffic on the Lafitte Greenway in New Orleans. Built as a board member of Bike Easy (a local bicycle advocacy group), this tool pulls data from eco-visio counters to show daily and year-to-date bike counts on the greenway. The project helps demonstrate the value of cycling infrastructure to the community by making usage data accessible and visually engaging. Uses Node.js/Express backend with a simple static frontend, containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
